This was never supposed to be anything more than a demo.  I had about 5 good reasons for doing it and I can share this publicly.

For a real product there is allot more work and areas of improvement are everywhere.
I can spend a year developing it further. 

Itâ€™s only been smoke tested so far. 

I am out of time with this and need to move on.
